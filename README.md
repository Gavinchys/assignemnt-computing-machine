The assignment code file contains R script that was used to:
1) Reduce the dimensionality of the automobile dataset via principal component analysis (PCA) followed by fitting a linear regression model on the selected principal components. The fitted linear regression model was then used to predict the cost of claims on a policy.
2) Trained a deep neural network on the freMTPL2freq dataset which contains the French Motor Third-Part Liability (MTPL) Claims. The neural network was trained to be predict the number of claims on a policy.

The assignment report discusses the ethical deployment of computer algorithms and possible measures insurance providers could implement. Additionally, it contains the findings obtained from the analysis carried out in the R script and the analysis of an additional yacht_insurance dataset.
